We are supplying for them exactly information and as quick as possible for their production.
We have two skill for research the first with short messages we are direct output on screen all information which has searched before on Golang code processes
other way when we are more than 10 records (realistic about 5 records) we will pull out to sreen with webview (It has built on .Net framework)
This technical wasn't new but quite suitable for us.
And last at the DB level , we have built jobs for process data such as flat data for quick access.
Summary:

  +Golang: process complicate progresses based on API,framework's Facebook.
  +.Net: Built webview for large,wide content messages.
  +.DB Oracle: Built Jobs with internal process for flat data
  +Ngrok: Virtual server for development (when run on production we deployed on new private domain)
